    <h1>Who are we?</h1>
    <p>We are Foot Traffic, a company founded in 2010 by three passionate young men, who shared a common love for stylish footware.<br>
        Realising that the shoes they wanted and admired were simply unaffordable, and that no other company offered the service that they were looking for,
        they took it upon themselves to find a solution.<br>
